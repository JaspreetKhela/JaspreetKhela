# Personal Interests

Personal interests across books, music, film, games, and new skills I'm exploring to stay curious and creative. I rotate through new topics often to keep ideas fresh, borrow patterns from unexpected places, and balance deep work with play. I keep a rolling list of what to sample next and what to revisit when I need a spark.
