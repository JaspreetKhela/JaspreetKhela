# Skilled Trades: Field Craft

Training plan for field craft across construction, electrical, mechanical, and safety skills so designs stay grounded in reality. Shop time, certifications, and site simulations drive practice with tools, materials, permits, sequencing, and safety so crews can install, service, and trust what gets built.

### Role & Capability Tiers
- **Foundations (Contributor/Analyst)**: Build baseline literacy, capture clean inputs, and execute core tasks with guidance.
