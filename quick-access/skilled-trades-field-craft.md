# Skilled Trades: Field Craft

Field craft across construction, electrical, mechanical, and safety skills that keep me practical when I design real-world systems. I like knowing how tools, materials, and safety practices actually work on-site, which helps me design solutions that crews can install, service, and trust. I keep notes on permits, site prep, sequencing, and how to avoid surprises once the plans meet the job site.
