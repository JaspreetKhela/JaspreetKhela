# Data: Engineering, Analysis, and Forecasting

Data engineering, analysis, and forecasting work: pipelines, experiments, and models that turn raw data into decisions. I map questions to metrics, clean and model data, run experiments, and surface results in dashboards people actually use, tying forecasts back to product and revenue goals. That includes schema design, ETL/ELT, feature stores, experiment design, and taking models to production with monitoring.
