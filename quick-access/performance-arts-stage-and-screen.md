# Performance Arts: Stage and Screen

Performance work for stage and screen: writing, movement, and on-camera practice to keep creative muscles sharp. I rehearse blocking, voice, and delivery to communicate with more clarity and presence, and I study audience cues so each run-through lands cleaner than the last. I also experiment with pacing, breath control, and framing so messages land consistently across formats.

### Role & Capability Tiers
