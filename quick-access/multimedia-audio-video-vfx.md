# Multimedia: Audio, Video, VFX

Multimedia practice in audio, video, and VFX to sharpen storytelling and inform product and brand design. I script, shoot, edit, and experiment with motion so products ship with clear narratives and visuals, and I match sound, pacing, and typography to the feeling a product should convey. Expect breakdowns on storyboards, lighting setups, color, and sound design that reinforce the message.
