# Software: Engineering, Integration, and Delivery

Software engineering, integration, and delivery across web, mobile, services, and cloud, with reliability and user experience front and center. I focus on designing clean interfaces, instrumenting services, and rolling out changes safely, pairing code quality with observability, accessibility, and calm on-call playbooks. I like clear specs, small PRs, automated tests, and gradual rollouts backed by metrics and feedback loops.
