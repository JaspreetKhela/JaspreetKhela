# Hardware: Electromechanical Systems

Electromechanical systems work: electronics, robotics, and embedded builds that connect software to the physical world. I prototype boards, wire up sensors and actuators, tune firmware, and pair devices with cloud services so they stay observable, safe, and maintainable in real environments. I care about enclosure design, power budgets, field updates, and test rigs that catch failures before they ship.
