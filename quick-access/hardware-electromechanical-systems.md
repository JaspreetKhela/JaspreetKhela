# Hardware: Electromechanical Systems

Electromechanical systems work: electronics, robotics, and embedded builds that connect software to the physical world. I prototype boards, wire up sensors and actuators, tune firmware, and pair devices with cloud services so they stay observable, safe, and maintainable in real environments. I care about enclosure design, power budgets, field updates, and test rigs that catch failures before they ship.

## Circuit Design And Prototyping
Design and prototype circuits with attention to power, signals, and component selection.
- [Coming Soon]

## Embedded Firmware Development
Write stable, debuggable firmware with clear interfaces to peripherals and reliable runtime behavior.
- [Coming Soon]

## Sensor Integration And Control Systems
Integrate sensors and actuators, implement calibration, and design safe control loops with clear failure modes.
- [Coming Soon]

## Mechanical Design And Enclosure Integration
Design assemblies and enclosures that are durable, serviceable, and realistic to build and maintain.
- [Coming Soon]

## Validation Testing And Safety Engineering
Build test rigs, validate reliability, and document safety expectations before devices ship.
- [Coming Soon]

## Manufacturing Readiness And Field Support
Prepare builds for production, create diagnostics, and design update paths that support real-world deployments.
- [Coming Soon]
