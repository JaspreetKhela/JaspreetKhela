# Academic Development: Mathematics, Natural Sciences, Engineering, Social Sciences, Arts, and Humanities

Academic development spanning mathematics, natural sciences, engineering, social sciences, arts, and humanities to keep my foundation broad and rigorous. I study proofs, experiments, systems, and culture to see patterns across domains, and to keep my technical work grounded in real-world context and human impact. I cycle between problem sets, lab-style tinkering, literature reviews, and writing to synthesize what I learn.

### Role & Capability Tiers
- **Foundations (Contributor/Analyst)**: Build baseline literacy, capture clean inputs, and execute core tasks with guidance.
- **Methods & Tools (Practitioner)**: Apply structured methods, templates, and instrumentation to deliver reliably and refine craft.
- **Applied Practice & Delivery (Manager/Lead)**: Lead workstreams, coordinate stakeholders, and ensure quality and impact in delivery.
- **Advanced Leadership & Research (Principal/Strategist)**: Set strategy, standards, and research or portfolio direction across teams.
