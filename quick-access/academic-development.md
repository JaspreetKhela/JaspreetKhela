# Academic Development: Mathematics, Natural Sciences, Engineering, Social Sciences, Arts, and Humanities

Academic development spanning mathematics, natural sciences, engineering, social sciences, arts, and humanities to keep my foundation broad and rigorous. I study proofs, experiments, systems, and culture to see patterns across domains, and to keep my technical work grounded in real-world context and human impact. I cycle between problem sets, lab-style tinkering, literature reviews, and writing to synthesize what I learn.
