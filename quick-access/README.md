# Learning & Capabilities Map

Six guideposts frame the capability stack: Foundations (Theory &amp; Cognition) with Academic and Personal; Physical Systems for Skilled Trades and Hardware; Digital Systems for Software; Information &amp; Decision Systems for Data; Organizational Systems for Business; Creative &amp; Expressive Systems for Multimedia and Performance. The flow moves from cultivating mental models, to manipulating the physical world, to building in code, to deriving insight, to steering collective effort, and then to rendering meaning. Each markdown page captures the courses, programs, and practice plans behind the matching header on the site. Chat and navigation links expand these sections automatically so readers can jump straight into the detailed markdown pages.

### Learning & Capabilities Map Framework
- Foundations / Theory: core principles, models, and standards.
- Applied / Projects: builds, labs, and fieldwork to put concepts into practice.
- Tools / Stack: domain tools, platforms, or frameworks.
- Practice / Assessment: drills, certification preparation, critiques, or performance review.
- Integration / Capstone: end-to-end delivery that combines multiple areas.
