# Quick Access

Capability stack from foundational disciplines to expressive work. Each markdown page captures the courses, programs, and practice plans behind the matching quick-access header on the site, sequenced from academics and personal systems through trades, hardware, software, data, business, multimedia, and performance.

## Order
1. Academic Training and Development: training and development in math, sciences, engineering, humanities, and research methods as the base layer.
2. Personal Training and Development: training and development in health, learning, routines, and composure to keep every other layer stable.
3. Skilled Trades Training and Development: training and development in hands-on craft to keep designs grounded in codes, safety, and buildability.
4. Hardware Training and Development: training and development in embedded, electromechanical, and test work to build reliable devices.
5. Software Training and Development: training and development in full-stack engineering to turn ideas into secure, reliable software.
6. Data Training and Development: training and development in analytics, engineering, and science to move from clean signal to confident decisions.
7. Business Training and Development: training and development in commercial fundamentals, strategy, finance, and venture building.
8. Multimedia Training and Development: training and development in production to tell clear visual and audio stories.
9. Performance Arts Training and Development: training and development in performance craft to sharpen communication, presence, and iteration.
