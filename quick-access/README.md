# Learning & Capabilities Map

The map is organized around six pillars. The first is Foundations, which covers theory and cognition and includes both academic growth and personal development. Physical Systems focuses on skilled trades and hardware work. Digital Systems centers on building software. Information & Decision Systems addresses data, analysis, and decision-making. Organizational Systems looks at how businesses operate and improve. Creative & Expressive Systems covers multimedia, arts, and performance. The flow moves from cultivating mental models, to manipulating the physical world, to building in code, to deriving insight, to steering collective effort, and then to rendering meaning. Each markdown page captures the courses, programs, and practice plans behind the matching header on the site. Chat and navigation links expand these sections automatically so readers can jump straight into the detailed markdown pages.

### Learning & Capabilities Map Framework
- Foundations / Theory: core principles, models, and standards.
- Applied / Projects: builds, labs, and fieldwork to put concepts into practice.
- Tools / Stack: domain tools, platforms, or frameworks.
- Practice / Assessment: drills, certification preparation, critiques, or performance review.
- Integration / Capstone: end-to-end delivery that combines multiple areas.
