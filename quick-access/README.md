# Quick Access

Quick links to domain pages that document the courses, programs, and practice plans I'm using to build each discipline. Business covers go-to-market and operations; software spans full-stack delivery; data covers pipelines and models; hardware focuses on embedded and prototypes; trades capture hands-on field craft; multimedia covers audio, video, and motion; performance covers stage and screen; academic tracks coursework and research; personal development covers health and learning systems; interests log curiosity projects.

## Structure
- Domain pages: One markdown file per domain in this folder.
- Subheadings: Topical areas inside each domain page.

## Contents
### Business: Sales, Operations, and Strategy
Training log for go-to-market strategy, pricing, sales execution, pipeline hygiene, and operations. Captures the courses and programs I'm using to build commercial judgment, playbooks, and process discipline.

### Hardware: Electromechanical Systems
Electromechanical systems training across electronics, robotics, and embedded builds that connect software to the physical world. Logs the courses and programs on design, firmware, power, and test rigs so devices can be monitored, tested, and debugged safely in the field.

### Software: Engineering, Integration, and Delivery
Software engineering, integration, and delivery across web, mobile, services, and cloud. Tracks the courses and programs I'm using to practice clean interfaces, observability, accessibility, and safe rollouts.

### Data: Engineering, Analysis, and Forecasting
Data engineering, analysis, and forecasting training covering pipelines, experiments, and models that turn raw data into decisions. Documents the courses and programs I'm using for instrumentation, modeling, experimentation, and production ML.

### Skilled Trades: Field Craft
Field craft across construction, electrical, mechanical, and safety skills that keep me practical when I design real-world systems. Documents the courses and programs I'm using on permits, layout, sequencing, commissioning, and avoiding surprises once the plans meet the job site.

### Multimedia: Audio, Video, VFX
Multimedia practice in audio, video, and VFX to sharpen storytelling and inform product and brand design. Tracks the courses and programs I'm using to script, shoot, edit, and experiment with motion, sound, and pacing.

### Performance Arts: Stage and Screen
Performance work for stage and screen: writing, movement, and on-camera practice to keep creative muscles sharp. Logs the courses and programs I'm using to rehearse blocking, voice, delivery, and audience awareness.

### Academic Development: Mathematics, Natural Sciences, Engineering, Social Sciences, Arts, and Humanities
Academic development spanning mathematics, natural sciences, engineering, social sciences, arts, and humanities to keep my foundation broad and rigorous. Catalogs the courses, programs, and research training I’m using to connect theory, experiments, systems, and culture.

### Personal Development: Health, Mindset, Languages
Personal development in health, mindset, and learning systems with routines and tools I lean on to stay steady outside of work. Captures the courses and programs I'm using for fitness, mindfulness, habit building, and language study so progress stays honest and sustainable.

### Personal Interests
Personal interests across books, music, film, games, and new skills I'm exploring to stay curious and creative. Logs the courses, workshops, and experiments I'm trying to keep ideas fresh and balanced with play.
