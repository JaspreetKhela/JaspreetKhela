# Quick Access

This directory holds domain pages used to catalogue academic and professional training courses under the appropriate subheadings. It is a quick-reference index for where a course belongs across the broader set of domains; course materials and syllabi live elsewhere.

## Structure
- Domain pages: One markdown file per domain in this folder.
- Subheadings: Topical areas inside each domain page.
- Course entries: Add course title, provider, and link beneath the fitting subheading to show placement at a glance.
