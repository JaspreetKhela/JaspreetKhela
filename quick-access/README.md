# Quick Access

Training-first snapshots of each domain with links to deeper breakdowns. Each page opens with the practice loops, drills, and simulations that develop the skill, so navigation stays focused on how to train rather than only what to know.

## Practice Structures (How to Use)
- Practice loops: plan → do → review → adjust cycles for a focused skill (e.g., weekly problem sets with solution review and revisions).
- Drills: short, targeted reps to build automaticity (e.g., 20 SQL joins, 10 derivative proofs, 15 outbound call openings).
- Simulations: realistic run-throughs to test skills end-to-end with low stakes (e.g., mock design review, incident response tabletop, sales discovery call).
- Katas: small, repeatable problems done deliberately for technique (common in coding and quantitative practice).
- Labs/experiments: hands-on builds or tests to apply theory and observe outcomes (sandboxed environments for professional practice).
- Cases/postmortems: structured analysis of real or simulated situations to extract patterns and lessons.
- Feedback loops: peer/coach/TA reviews and self-retros that turn reps into growth by acting on critique.
