# Learning & Capabilities Map

This quick-access set outlines the capability stack from foundational disciplines to expressive work. Each markdown page captures the courses, programs, and practice plans behind the matching header on the site. Headings follow the rationale used on the webpage: Foundations (academic, personal) for base cognition and routines, Physical Systems (skilled trades, hardware) for buildability, Digital Systems (software) for engineered services, Information &amp; Decision Systems (data) for signal-to-decision flows, Organizational Systems (business) for commercial execution, and Creative &amp; Expressive Systems (multimedia, performance) for storytelling and presence. The headers are sequenced from foundational cognition and routines through field craft, technical builds, analytical systems, commercial execution, and creative expression. Chat and navigation links expand these sections automatically so readers can jump straight into the detailed markdown pages.

### Learning & Capabilities Map Framework
- Foundations / Theory: core principles, models, and standards.
- Applied / Projects: builds, labs, and fieldwork to put concepts into practice.
- Tools / Stack: domain tools, platforms, or frameworks.
- Practice / Assessment: drills, certification prep, critiques, or performance review.
- Integration / Capstone: end-to-end delivery that combines multiple areas.
