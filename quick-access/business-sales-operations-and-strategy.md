# Business: Sales, Operations, and Strategy

Sales, operations, and strategy experiments I'm packaging into case studies, covering how I test offers, build pipelines, tune operations, and share what works. I map markets, build playbooks, and stress-test processes so the next iteration is easier to ship and scale. Expect notes on discovery calls, pricing tests, deal reviews, and runbooks for onboarding, retention, and ops hygiene.
