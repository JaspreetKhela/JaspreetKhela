### Motto
**Preparation. Pace. Patience. Persistence. Facta, Non Verba.**

<a name="background"/>

### Background
I was curious about the universe's intricacies during my formative years: the Zermelo-Fraenkel-Choice (ZFC) axiomatic system and logically-deduced theorems of mathematics; the precision of the natural sciences; the godly feats of engineering and technology; the vastness of the life sciences and medicine; the complexities of the social sciences and management; the transcendental experiences of the arts and humanities; and my athletic capabilities. I am focused on actualizing my potential in these domains. Excellence is what I aspire to and self-improvement is what I strive for. Echoing the University of Toronto's motto, Velut Arbor Ã†vo.

<a name="goals"/>

### Goals
I aspire to become a mathematician (specializing in mathematical applications in physics, computer science, statistics, economics, chemistry, biology, and philosophy). Specifically, over the short-term, I desire to work on: technical research and development/engineering projects in quantum computing, machine learning, cryptography, nuclear fusion, surgery, and finance; and non-technical projects in business development, operations, and sales. Generally, over the long-term, I desire to work in: the private sector as an entrepreneur and a creative artist; and the public sector as a mathematician in academic and government research institutes and facilities, Combat Arms operator in the Canadian Armed Forces, healthcare worker, social worker, and public servant.

<a name="personality"/>

### Personality
Personality traits are defined as habitual patterns of emotions, thoughts, and behaviours. They are relatively stable over time, are relatively consistent across situations, influence behaviour, and differ across individuals. My personality is summarized as follows:
- **Five-Factor Model (FFM)**: I possess: a relatively low level of extraversion; average levels of agreeableness, neuroticism, and openness; and a relatively high level of conscientiousness.

### Academic Development History and Pursuits
The following academic development history and pursuits section outlines my areas of expertise developed through my enrollment in post-secondary programs and their corresponding courses during my adulthood. 
I have primarily focused on developing my expertise in: theoretical and applied [mathematics](#mathematics); theoretical, applied, and experimental [physics](#physics); theoretical and applied [computer science](#computer-science); theoretical and applied [economics](#economics); theoretical and applied [chemistry](#chemistry); and theoretical and applied [statistics](#statistics). My interest in the domains of mathematics (i.e. mathematics, statistics, and computer science) and the natural sciences (i.e. physics and chemistry) stems from my desire to develop a deep, broad, and rigorous understanding of the nature of logical reasoning, abstract thinking, geometric intuition, physical intuition, and pattern recognition to better navigate the complexities of reality in an efficient and effective manner. Moreover, in general, I hope to actualize my fluid intelligence's potential. My interest in the domains of the social sciences (i.e. economics) stems from my desire to develop a deep, broad, and rigorous understanding of the nature of the how and why economies (i.e. various modes of value transactions) function the way that they do. 
Moreover, I hope to leverage my understanding of these domains in various practitioner roles (e.g. software engineer, data scientist, product designer, product manager, entrepreneur, physician-scientist, etc. roles) and theoretician roles (i.e. mathematical physicist roles in industrial research and development departments, academic institutions, etc.) that I aspire to be in over the span of my lifetime.
