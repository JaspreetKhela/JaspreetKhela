# Hello, I'm Jaspreet Khela! 👋
Welcome! If you’ve ever wondered what happens when a curious overthinker with a Wi-Fi connection sets out to become their best self, this is it.

Below is a guided overview of what I’ve built so far, what I’m working on now, and what I’m practicing to improve. It brings together my education and work experience, the technical and creative skills I’m sharpening, and the interests that shape my curiosity and long-term goals. It also covers the routines that help me stay healthy and consistent, along with the communication habits I rely on to work well with others. Taken together, it’s a practical snapshot of how I learn, execute, and grow over time.

## About Me
**Jaspreet Khela's Digital Doorstep**

Hello, world! I pair mathematics, natural sciences, engineering, and economics to build dependable hardware, software, data, and IT systems anchored in product design. When I'm not shipping, I'm probably burning another grilled cheese for science.

I lean on clear thinking that cuts through noise, steady execution, and outcomes you can rely on every time.

I'm a Toronto-based full-stack engineer who blends hardware, software, data, operations, and product design to ship systems that hold up in production.

### Motto
Preparation. Pace. Patience. Persistence. Facta, Non Verba. Do the groundwork, move steadily, stay calm through slow climbs, and let shipped work speak louder than claims.

### Background
I grew up bouncing between math puzzles at the kitchen table, science kits in the garage, sketching and producing music in the evenings, history books on weekends, and sports drills after school. That mix of mathematics, natural sciences, engineering, life sciences, social sciences, arts, humanities, and athletic practice taught me to <span class="highlight"><b>test ideas with proof and experiment, study how people organize and lead, and blend creative exploration with technical rigor. Velut Arbor Ӕvo.</b></span>

### Goals
Near term, I want to contribute to technical R&D in quantum computing, machine learning, cryptography, nuclear fusion, surgery, and finance, alongside business development, operations, and sales work. Long term, I hope to blend creative work and service as an artist, entrepreneur, and mathematician, and in the public sphere serve through research, defense, healthcare, social work, and public service. Those paths keep me inventive, useful, and grounded in service.

### Personality
My MBTI is INTJ. On the Five-Factor model I sit lower on extraversion and prefer focused solo work or small, tight teams, stepping up when objectives are clear. I am moderately agreeable, collaborating respectfully while giving direct feedback with a bias for quality and safety. I score high on conscientiousness, planning ahead, keeping commitments, and leaning on checklists, metrics, and clear ownership to ship reliably. I am low to moderate on neuroticism, steady under pressure, and I use routines to avoid overwork and overthinking. I am moderate to high on openness, curious across disciplines, mixing structured study with experiments, and pairing new ideas with evidence and practicality.

### Capabilities
I enjoy shaping strategy, making things, and leading teams. I lean on quantitative analysis, storytelling, and clear communication to turn ambiguous goals into plans, align people, and build the software, hardware, data, and operational pieces that make the plan real.

### Working Style
I work best with clear writing, shared context, and tight feedback loops. In practice, I aim to align early on goals and constraints, communicate progress clearly, and give and receive feedback with respect.

<a id="academic-professional-and-personal-focuses"></a>
## Academic, Professional, and Personal Focuses
### Core Pillars
I stay versatile by switching disciplines, testing ideas quickly, and translating lessons between them. Action plus reflection moves work from prototype to polish without losing momentum.

### Academic Focus
I study mathematics, natural sciences, engineering, and economics to understand how systems behave, scale, and stay stable. Mathematics sharpens proof, modeling, and probabilistic thinking. Natural sciences keep me grounded in observation and experimentation. Engineering turns constraints into reliable hardware and software. Economics frames incentives, markets, and trade-offs. Together these lenses help me spot patterns early, design resilient systems, and choose interventions that hold up in the real world.

### Professional Focus
I build dependable, human-centered products by bridging software, hardware, data, IT operations, and product design. I connect user research to technical choices and roll out changes safely so services stay usable and reliable in production.

### Personal Pursuits
I prototype side projects, study human factors and design, and keep tinkering to stay curious. Rotating between coding, electronics, writing, and design keeps the work fresh and feeds small improvements back into daily work.

### Fortune Favors the Brave
This Latin proverb reminds me to lean into hard, stretching work where the biggest learning happens. Prepare well, move with intent, stay patient, and iterate until the work is reliable, teachable, and useful to others.
