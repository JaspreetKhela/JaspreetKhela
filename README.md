<a name="motto"/>

### Motto
**Preparation. Pace. Patience. Persistence. Facta, Non Verba.**

<a name="background"/>

### Background
I was curious about the universe's intricacies during my formative years: the Zermelo-Fraenkel-Choice (ZFC) axiomatic system and logically-deduced theorems of mathematics; the precision of the natural sciences; the godly feats of engineering and technology; the vastness of the life sciences and medicine; the complexities of the social sciences and management; the transcendental experiences of the arts and humanities; and my athletic capabilities. I am focused on actualizing my potential in these domains. Excellence is what I aspire to and self-improvement is what I strive for. Echoing the University of Toronto's motto, Velut Arbor Ævo.

<a name="goals"/>

### Goals
I aspire to become a mathematician (specializing in mathematical applications in physics, computer science, statistics, economics, chemistry, biology, and philosophy). Specifically, over the short-term, I desire to work on: technical research and development/engineering projects in quantum computing, machine learning, cryptography, nuclear fusion, surgery, and finance; and non-technical projects in business development, operations, and sales. Generally, over the long-term, I desire to work in: the private sector as an entrepreneur and a creative artist; and the public sector as a mathematician in academic and government research institutes and facilities, Combat Arms operator in the Canadian Armed Forces, healthcare worker, social worker, and public servant.

<a name="personality"/>

Below, you will find an outline of my personal, academic, and professional development history and (current and future) pursuits. The purpose of these sections is to provide readers with an overview of my self-development journey so that readers can better understand my domains of competencies and avenues for collaborations on prospective projects. My hope is that readers may also draw ideas/inspirations for their self-development journey as they examine my self-development journey.

<a name="personal"/>

### Personal Development History and Pursuits
The following personal development history and pursuits section outlines the non-academic and non-professional pursuits that I have embarked upon or will embark upon over the span of my adulthood. 

I have primarily focused on developing my expertise in the arts and humanities, combat training, and the skilled trades. My interest in the arts and humanities stems from my desire to develop a broad, deep, and rigorous understanding of the culinary arts, baking and pastry arts, storytelling, analog and digital static and dynamic design materials and techniques (i.e. music performance and production, illustration, graphic design, animation, photography, and film production materials and techniques), theatre arts, dance performance, and art culture. My interest in combat training stems from my desire to develop a broad and deep understanding of the mindset and mechanics of an individual dealing with physical interpersonal conflicts. My interest in the skilled trades stems from my desire to develop a broad and deep understanding of the building blocks of the physical world through studying construction, plumbing, electrical, and welding techniques.

The tail-end of this section also outlines works of literature that aid in the development of a growth and an antifragile mindset and help to facilitate a deeper understanding of the human condition.

**Mindset Literature**:

The following works of literature that I have read or I am planning on reading are centred around the development of a growth and an antifragile mindset. Individuals who believe their talents can be developed (i.e. through hard work, good strategies, and input from others) have a growth mindset. They tend to achieve more than those with a more fixed mindset (i.e. those who believe their talents are innate gifts). Antifragility is defined as being resilient or adaptive in the face of extreme stressors, chaos, and disorder.

### Academic Development History and Pursuits
The following academic development history and pursuits section outlines my areas of expertise developed through my enrollment in post-secondary programs and their corresponding courses during my adulthood. 

I have primarily focused on developing my expertise in: theoretical and applied [mathematics](#mathematics); theoretical, applied, and experimental [physics](#physics); theoretical and applied [computer science](#computer-science); theoretical and applied [economics](#economics); theoretical and applied [chemistry](#chemistry); and theoretical and applied [statistics](#statistics). My interest in the domains of mathematics (i.e. mathematics, statistics, and computer science) and the natural sciences (i.e. physics and chemistry) stems from my desire to develop a broad, deep, and rigorous understanding of the nature of logical reasoning, abstract thinking, geometric intuition, physical intuition, and pattern recognition to better navigate the complexities of reality in an efficient and effective manner. Moreover, in general, I hope to actualize my fluid intelligence's potential. My interest in the domains of the social sciences (i.e. economics) stems from my desire to develop a broad, deep, and rigorous understanding of the nature of the how and why economies (i.e. various modes of value transactions) function the way that they do. 

Moreover, I hope to leverage my understanding of these domains in various practitioner roles (e.g. software engineer, data scientist, product designer, product manager, entrepreneur, etc. roles) and theoretician roles (i.e. mathematical physicist, physician-scientist, etc. roles in industrial research and development departments, academic institutions, etc.) that I aspire to be in over the span of my lifetime.

Note that I have not listed some graudate courses that I plan to take in the future since I am not sure of when those courses will be taken. Additionally, many of the non-cross-listed undergraudate courses in mathematics and physics that I have or will be taking are accelerated courses that cover content that would normally be covered in graduate courses at other universities, which is why some of those courses are viewed as exclusion courses for their graduate-level counterparts.

* **Trinity College, University of Toronto**:  <a name="utoronto"/>
  * **Degree**: Honours Bachelor of Science Degree
  * **Fields Of Study**: 
    * **Mathematics and Physics Specialist**: Mathematics is the study of shapes, quantities, patterns, and structures. It serves as a tool for our scientific understanding of the world. Knowledge of mathematics opens gateways to a variety of professions in domains such as economics, finance, computing, engineering, and the natural sciences. Aside from practical considerations, mathematics can be a highly satisfying intellectual pursuit with career opportunities in teaching and research. In the Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, Mathematics and Physics, and Mathematics and Philosophy specialist programs, students acquire in-depth knowledge and expertise in mathematical reasoning and the language of mathematics with an emphasis on rigour and precision. These programs are designed for students wishing to pursue graduate studies; most of the graduates of these programs continue on to graduate school with some of them gaining admission to the world’s best graduate schools.
    * **Mathematical Applications in Economics and Finance Specialist**: The Mathematical Applications in Economics and Finance specialist program is designed to prepare students for direct entry into the world of finance. It can also serve as a gateway to an MBA or a Master of Finance degree, possibly followed by an eventual doctorate.
    * **Chemistry Minor**: Chemistry is a challenging intellectual pursuit and a dominant force in shaping our civilization. Chemistry places a strong emphasis on an understanding of the structures and properties of individual atoms and molecules and on using this understanding to interpret and predict the behaviour of matter. Many of the concepts of physics and the methods of mathematics are basic to chemistry. Chemistry is of fundamental importance to many other subjects including astrophysics, biological sciences, environmental science, geology, materials science, and medical sciences. These and other aspects of the subject are reflected in the courses offered and the programs recommended by the Department. <a name="mathematics"/>
