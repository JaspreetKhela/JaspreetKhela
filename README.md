I aspire to become a mathematician, specializing in mathematical applications in the formal, natural, and life sciences. My short-term aims include working on technical research and development projects in areas like quantum computing, machine learning, cryptography, nuclear fusion, surgery, and finance, as well as non-technical projects in business development, operations, and sales. In the long term, I plan to engage in the private sector as a creative artist, entrepreneur, and mathematician, and in the public sector as a mathematician (within academic and government research institutes and facilities), military operator, healthcare worker, social worker, and public servant.
