### Motto
**Preparation. Pace. Patience. Persistence. Facta, Non Verba.**

<a name="background"/>

### Background
I was curious about the universe's intricacies during my formative years: the Zermelo-Fraenkel-Choice (ZFC) axiomatic system and logically-deduced theorems of mathematics; the precision of the natural sciences; the godly feats of engineering and technology; the vastness of the life sciences and medicine; the complexities of the social sciences and management; the transcendental experiences of the arts and humanities; and my athletic capabilities. I am focused on actualizing my potential in these domains. Excellence is what I aspire to and self-improvement is what I strive for. Echoing the University of Toronto's motto, Velut Arbor Ã†vo.

<a name="goals"/>

### Goals
I aspire to become a mathematician (specializing in mathematical applications in physics, computer science, statistics, economics, chemistry, biology, and philosophy). Specifically, over the short-term, I desire to work on: technical research and development/engineering projects in quantum computing, machine learning, cryptography, nuclear fusion, surgery, and finance; and non-technical projects in business development, operations, and sales. Generally, over the long-term, I desire to work in: the private sector as an entrepreneur and a creative artist; and the public sector as a mathematician in academic and government research institutes and facilities, Combat Arms operator in the Canadian Armed Forces, healthcare worker, social worker, and public servant.

<a name="personal"/>

### Personal Development History and Pursuits
The following personal development history and pursuits section outlines the non-academic and non-professional pursuits that I have embarked upon or will embark upon over the span of my adulthood. 
I have primarily focused on developing my expertise in the arts and humanities, combat training, and the skilled trades. My interest in the arts and humanities stems from my desire to develop a broad, deep, and rigorous understanding of the culinary arts, baking and pastry arts, storytelling, analog and digital static and dynamic design materials and techniques (i.e. music performance and production, illustration, graphic design, animation, photography, and film production materials and techniques), theatre arts, dance performance, and art culture. My interest in combat training stems from my desire to develop a broad and deep understanding of the mindset and mechanics of an individual dealing with physical interpersonal conflicts. My interest in the skilled trades stems from my desire to develop a broad and deep understanding of the building blocks of the physical world through studying construction, plumbing, electrical, and welding techniques.

### Academic Development History and Pursuits
The following academic development history and pursuits section outlines my areas of expertise developed through my enrollment in post-secondary programs and their corresponding courses during my adulthood. 
I have primarily focused on developing my expertise in: theoretical and applied [mathematics](#mathematics); theoretical, applied, and experimental [physics](#physics); theoretical and applied [computer science](#computer-science); theoretical and applied [economics](#economics); theoretical and applied [chemistry](#chemistry); and theoretical and applied [statistics](#statistics). My interest in the domains of mathematics (i.e. mathematics, statistics, and computer science) and the natural sciences (i.e. physics and chemistry) stems from my desire to develop a broad, deep, and rigorous understanding of the nature of logical reasoning, abstract thinking, geometric intuition, physical intuition, and pattern recognition to better navigate the complexities of reality in an efficient and effective manner. Moreover, in general, I hope to actualize my fluid intelligence's potential. My interest in the domains of the social sciences (i.e. economics) stems from my desire to develop a broad, deep, and rigorous understanding of the nature of the how and why economies (i.e. various modes of value transactions) function the way that they do. 
Moreover, I hope to leverage my understanding of these domains in various practitioner roles (e.g. software engineer, data scientist, product designer, product manager, entrepreneur, physician-scientist, etc. roles) and theoretician roles (i.e. mathematical physicist roles in industrial research and development departments, academic institutions, etc.) that I aspire to be in over the span of my lifetime.

Note that I have not listed some graudate courses that I plan to take in the future since I am not sure of when those courses will be taken.

Knowledge of mathematics opens gateways to a variety of professions in domains such as economics, finance, computing, engineering, and the natural sciences. Aside from practical considerations, mathematics can be a highly satisfying intellectual pursuit with career opportunities in teaching and research. In the Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, Mathematics and Physics, and Mathematics and Philosophy specialist programs, students acquire in-depth knowledge and expertise in mathematical reasoning and the language of mathematics with an emphasis on rigour and precision. These programs are designed for students wishing to pursue graduate studies; most of the graduates of these programs continue on to graduate school with some of them gaining admission to the worldâ€™s best graduate schools.
    * **Mathematical Applications in Economics and Finance Specialist**: The Mathematical Applications in Economics and Finance specialist program is designed to prepare students for direct entry into the world of finance.

    * **Chemistry Minor**: Chemistry is a challenging intellectual pursuit and a dominant force in shaping our civilization. Chemistry places a strong emphasis on an understanding of the structures and properties of individual atoms and molecules and on using this understanding to interpret and predict the behaviour of matter. Many of the concepts of physics and the methods of mathematics are basic to chemistry. Chemistry is of fundamental importance to many other subjects including astrophysics, biological sciences, environmental science, geology, materials science, and medical sciences. These and other aspects of the subject are reflected in the courses offered and the programs recommended by the Department. <a name="mathematics"/>
