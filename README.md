## Personal Background and Goals
### 💡 Motto
**Preparation. Pace. Patience. Persistence. Facta, Non Verba.**

### 📘 Background
During my formative years, I was captivated by the universe's intricacies: from the foundational Zermelo-Fraenkel-Choice (ZFC) axiomatic system and the logically deduced theorems of mathematics, to the precision of the natural sciences, the remarkable feats of engineering and technology, the vastness of life sciences and medicine, the complexities of social sciences and management, the transcendental experiences offered by the arts and humanities, and the exploration of my athletic capabilities. I am committed to actualizing my potential in these domains, aspiring to excellence and dedicated to continual self-improvement. In this journey, I find resonance with the University of Toronto's enduring motto, 'Velut Arbor Ævo.'

### 🎯 Goals
I aspire to become a mathematician, specializing in mathematical applications in the formal, natural, and life sciences. My short-term aims include working on technical research and development projects in areas like quantum computing, machine learning, cryptography, nuclear fusion, surgery, and finance, as well as non-technical projects in business development, operations, and sales. In the long term, I plan to engage in the private sector as a creative artist, entrepreneur, and mathematician, and in the public sector as a mathematician (within academic and government research institutes and facilities), military operator, healthcare worker, social worker, and public servant.

### 😊 Personality
My personality traits, which are habitual patterns of emotion, thought, and behavior, include:
- **Five-Factor Model (FFM)**: Relatively low level of extraversion; average levels of agreeableness, neuroticism, and openness; and a relatively high level of conscientiousness.
- **HEXACO-PI-R**: [Test Results](https://dropbox.com/s/ocep5hmbkduw6lh/Test%20Result.pdf?dl=0)
- **Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)**: [INTJ](https://16personalities.com/intj-personality)
- **Dark Triad Test**: [Test Results](https://dropbox.com/s/l063j1feu0dbejt/Dark%20Triad%20Test%20Results.pdf?dl=0)

### 🌟 Capabilities
- **Strengths**: Strategizing, Creating, Leading
- **Hard Skills**: Quantitative Analysis, Multimedia Production
- **Soft Skills**: Critical Thinking, Communication
