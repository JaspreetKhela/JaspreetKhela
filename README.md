Below, you will find a reverse chronological overview of my journey as a professional and student through employment and volunteer experiences that I have accrued since the beginning of my secondary education.

### Motto
**Preparation. Pace. Patience. Persistence. Facta, Non Verba.**

### Background
I was curious about the universe's intricacies during my formative years: the Zermelo-Fraenkel-Choice (ZFC) axiomatic system and logically-deduced theorems of mathematics; the precision of the natural sciences; the godly feats of engineering and technology; the vastness of the life sciences and medicine; the complexities of the social sciences and management; the transcendental experiences of the arts and humanities; and my athletic capabilities. I am focused on actualizing my potential in these domains. Excellence is what I aspire to and self-improvement is what I strive for. Echoing the University of Toronto's motto, Velut Arbor Ã†vo.

### Goals
I aspire to become a mathematician (specializing in mathematical applications in physics, computer science, statistics, economics, chemistry, biology, and philosophy). Specifically, over the short-term, I desire to work on: technical research and development/engineering projects in quantum computing, machine learning, cryptography, nuclear fusion, surgery, and finance; and non-technical projects in business development, operations, and sales. Generally, over the long-term, I desire to work in: the private sector as an entrepreneur and a creative artist; and the public sector as a mathematician in academic and government research institutes and facilities, Combat Arms operator in the Canadian Armed Forces, healthcare worker, social worker, and public servant.

### Personality
Personality traits are defined as habitual patterns of emotions, thoughts, and behaviours. They are relatively stable over time, are relatively consistent across situations, influence behaviour, and differ across individuals. My personality is summarized as follows:
- **Five-Factor Model (FFM)**: I possess: a relatively low level of extraversion; average levels of agreeableness, neuroticism, and openness; and a relatively high level of conscientiousness.
- **HEXACO-PI-R**: dropbox.com/s/ocep5hmbkduw6lh/Test%20Result.pdf?dl=0
- **Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)**: INTJ (16personalities.com/intj-personality)
- **Dark Triad Test**: dropbox.com/s/l063j1feu0dbejt/Dark%20Triad%20Test%20Results.pdf?dl=0

### Capabilities
- **Strengths**: Strategizing, Creating, Leading
- **Hard Skills**: Quantitative Analysis, Multimedia Production
- **Soft Skills**: Critical Thinking, Communication
